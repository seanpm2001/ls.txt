# [ls.txt specification](#lstxt-specification)

**By:** [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

**Version:** `1.0 (2022, Sunday, September 4th at 6:03 pm PST)`

`*ls.txt` is a subdomain extension to the plain text file format `*.txt`. The 2 formats function entirely the same, with the exception that `*.ls.txt` is generally for lists, and may have special ways of rendering by the system.

The `.ls` has to come before the `.txt` extension.

## [MIMETYPE](/MIMETYPE/MIMETYPE.ls.txt)

The MIMETYPE for `*.ls.txt` is:

```text
text/plain+list
```

Compared to the normal `*.txt` mimetype, which is just:

```text
text/plain
```
